The expected value (also known as the mathematical expectation or mean) of a random variable is a measure of its average value over many repetitions of a experiment. It is denoted as E(X) and is defined as the sum of the product of each possible outcome of the random variable X and its probability of occurrence.

Example:

Let's say we have a fair six-sided die, and X is a random variable representing the outcome of rolling the die. The expected value of X would be: E(X) = (1 * 1/6) + (2 * 1/6) + (3 * 1/6) + (4 * 1/6) + (5 * 1/6) + (6 * 1/6) = 3.5
