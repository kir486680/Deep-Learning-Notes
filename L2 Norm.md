The L2 norm, also known as the Euclidean norm, is a type of norm or measure of the size of a vector or function in a given space. The L2 norm of a vector x in n-dimensional space is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of its individual components:

$||x||_2 = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 }$


The subscript 2 in the notation ||x||_2 refers to the fact that we are using the L2 norm, which is the square root of the sum of squares. The L2 norm can be used to measure the length or magnitude of a vector or function, and it satisfies the following properties:

2.  Properties of the L2 norm:

	The L2 norm satisfies the following properties:
	
	a. Non-negativity:
	
	$||x||_2 \geq 0, \text{ for any vector } x$
	
	and
	
	$||x||_2 = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 0$
	
	b. Homogeneity:
	
	$||a \cdot x||_2 = |a| \cdot ||x||_2, \text{ for any scalar } a \text{ and vector } x$
	
	c. Triangle inequality:
	
	$||x + y||_2 \leq ||x||_2 + ||y||_2, \text{ for any vectors } x \text{ and } y$


The L2 norm is commonly used in various applications, including signal processing, data analysis, and machine learning, where it can be used to measure the similarity or distance between vectors or to quantify the error or loss in a model.
