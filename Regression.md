Regression is the hammer we reach for when we want to answer _how much?_ or _how many?_ questions. If you want to predict the number of dollars (price) at which a house will be sold, or the number of wins a baseball team might have, or the number of days that a patient will remain hospitalized before being discharged, then you are probably looking for a regression model. However, even within regression models, there are important distinctions. For instance, the price of a house will never be negative and changes might often be _relative_ to its baseline price. As such, it might be more effective to regress on the logarithm of the price. Likewise, the number of days a patient spends in hospital is a _discrete nonnegative_ random variable. As such, least mean squares might not be an ideal approach either. This sort of time-to-event modeling comes with a host of other complications that are dealt with in a specialized subfield called _survival modeling_.
