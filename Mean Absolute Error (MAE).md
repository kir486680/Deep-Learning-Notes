Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a commonly used metric in regression analysis to measure the average difference between predicted and actual values. It is defined as:

$$MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i - \hat{y_i}|$$

where $n$ is the number of samples, $y_i$ is the actual value, and $\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted value.

MAE is a simple and easy-to-understand metric because it measures the absolute difference between predicted and actual values in the same units as the original data. It is robust to outliers and does not penalize large errors more than small errors. However, MAE does not take into account the direction of errors, which means that overpredictions and underpredictions are treated equally. In some cases, this might not be desirable, and a metric that distinguishes between over and underpredictions such as [[Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)]] or [[Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)]] might be more appropriate.

In summary, MAE is a simple and robust metric that measures the absolute difference between predicted and actual values in the same units as the original data. It is useful when you want to penalize all errors equally and don't care about the direction of errors. If you want to measure the relative error, MAPE might be more appropriate. If you want to penalize large errors more than small errors, RMSE might be more suitable.
