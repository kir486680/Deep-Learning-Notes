To measure correlation, we usually use the Pearson correlation coefficient, it gives an estimate of the correlation between two variables.

To compute Pearson’s coefficient, we multiply deviations from the mean for `X` times those for `Y` and divide by the product of the standard deviations. Here is the formula: [2]

_Note: as always – it’s important to understand how you calculate Pearson’s coefficient – but luckily, it’s implemented in pandas, so you don’t have to type the whole formula into Python all the time, you can just call the right function… more about that later._

Pearson’s correlation coefficient is good to measure **linear correlation.**
