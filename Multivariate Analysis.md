It has become common practice these days for companies and businesses to collect as much information as reasonably possible, even if the use cases of such data are unknown at the time of collection — the hope is to understand and use the data at some point in the future. Once such data sets are available, data-driven individuals will dive into the data looking for the hidden patterns and relationships within the data. One of the tools of finding such hidden patterns in the data is multivariate analysis.

_Multivariate_ analysis involves analyzing the relationships between multiple variables (i.e. multivariate data) and understanding how they influence each other. It is an important tool that helps us better understand complex data sets to make data-driven and informed decisions.
