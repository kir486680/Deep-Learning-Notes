Heterogeneity in statistics means that your populations, samples or results are different. It is the opposite of [[Homogeneity]], which means that the population/data/results are the same.

A heterogeneous population or sample is one where every member has a different value for the characteristic you’re interested in. For example, if everyone in your group varied between 4’3″ and 7’6″ tall, they would be heterogeneous for height. In real life, heterogeneous populations are extremely common. For example, patients are typically a very heterogeneous population as they differ with many factors including demographics, diagnostic test results, and medical histories.

Heterogeneity in Clinical Trials and Meta-Analysis
In clinical trials and meta-analysis, heterogeneity of results means that studies have widely varying outcomes. Some studies might show favorable results, while others show unfavorable results. For example, some studies may say that sugar is linked to obesity, while others report that sugar isn’t linked to obesity (outside of it being a source of calories).

Statistical heterogeneity only comes to light after results from studies are analyzed. Ways to figure out if the results are homogeneous or not (i.e. if they all agree or disagree) include:
